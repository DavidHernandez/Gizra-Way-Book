# Who Are We
###The Amitai and Brice Story:

A couple of guys, with a pretty interesting perspective, joined forces, synergized, made a lot of mistakes, learned and repeated.  They like the idea of open source, in fact they like the idea of open everything. After plenty of failures and pretty amazing success, these guys, with the help of their team, are still paving the way in the interesting world of web development.

###The Gizra Way:

The Gizra story is about a way, an outlook, a philosophy that navigates through all aspects of a web development company. It is knowing and acting on the understanding that *we can do better.*

It is summed up nicely under four sections of The Gizra Way. Let’s talk about them:

**Transparency**.  Everything is out in the open, wart and all.  This may be new to you and may take some adjustment. We set the tone as early as our price estimations by basing them on a detailed breakdown of project tasks (small chunks of 12 hours or less) with their cost.  This is continued into our projects where our clients have full access to Github and they see everything - including our internal communications. Even this guide is open to the public. 

**Open Communication**. We work hard to create a common language with our clients and to set expectations early on and this applies internally as well.  

**Meticulous Execution**. This area is the core of how we do things.  We implement many processes to ensure the highest technical standards. For example, a complete deployment and testing system is built into our projects, we use our own Gizra developed testing toolkit, and do pixel-perfect design implementation.

**Investment in you and the community**. We can do better is about bettering ourselves and others as an organization and also as individuals.  You can become better by embracing our mentoring process that will usually keep you on your toes - being a little uncomfortable means you are stretching your bounds.  We also really want to see you want to contribute and encouraged you to contribute to the open-source community on company time.

Keep in mind and check yourself against these Gizra values. It will guide you in situations you still don’t have an answer for and set the standards you should want to reach.

###Our purpose:

The industry problem we face is that there is a high failure rate in web projects due to bad project management. The projects don’t meet any one of the three criteria of a success: being on time, in budget and with happy users. 

So, if you intersect the Gizra Way with what is going on outside, our purpose becomes clear:

**For Gizra, the world will be a better place if more web projects realize that there is a better way.**
