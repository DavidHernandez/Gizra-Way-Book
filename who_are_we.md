# Who Are We
###The Amitai and Brice Story:

A couple of guys, with a pretty interesting perspective, joined forces, synergized, made a lot of mistakes, learned and got better.  They like the idea of open source, in fact they like the idea of open everything. After plenty of failures and pretty amazing success, these guys, with the help of this team, are still paving the way in the interesting world of web development.
