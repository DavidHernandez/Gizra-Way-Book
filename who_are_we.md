# Who Are We

The question of "who are we" can be hard to answer. Or very simple. It all depends on your point of view. If you are looking at us from far enough than it will be quite simple. We are a web development company.

But looking at things from far can be boring. In fact, if you are reading this chapter you are probably looking at a more zoomed in explanation. So lets zoom.

## Early days

Brice Lenfant and Amitai Burstein, now the co-owners of Gizra have met for the first time at around 1998. Later in 2002 they have re-met through different socials events, by chance became balcony to balcony neighbors. At 2004 they worked together in an Israeli software company for the textille industry.

On 2005 Brice and his wife moved to the New-York, to work as the support and QA manager for the US branch.

On 2006 after Amitai has finished his B.A in fashion design in Shenkar, he and his wife moved to Delhi, India to become the regional manager of the south east area, supervising over a dozen local team.

On 2007 Amita and Brice combining both their deep knowledge of the textile industry, pattern making and of course software development have invented a new system called MTM (Made To Measure). It was a way for people to enter their body measurements and get a pattern for a garment that fits them precisely. Precision that usually can be reached only by going to a tailor. If for some reason you are interested in seeing how in depth we had the concept covered you can read this [online article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwinkky6CHY9NZHB6HDcrRE88XaG7Avkz456sj1GN4o/edit?usp=sharing) we have published.

Being so excited about this revolutionary approach to MTM we have decided to form a partnership, register our company and work on simplePDM. A web site that would allow pattern makers to digitally manage their files, catalogues and collections. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMj1w3Sx9_U) we created (and we mean _we created_ - we wrote, drew, recorded and edited all ourself back at those days) could help understand the concept. It's like Google Docs, but specific for the textile and garment industry.

The technological decision to go with Drupal we equally owe to a good investment of time in finding the right technology and to pure luck. At the time it seemed better than other options, who no days most of them don't event exist.

As good startup-y stories go, Amitai's balcony was Gizra's office on those early days. Brice and Amitai have started learning Drupal and the world of web. In fact, to be completely honest, while Brice already came with some coding experience it was Amitai's first steps in the coding world.

Embracing from the very beginning the nature of open source we have started contributing back to the community. Gizra's [first module](https://www.drupal.org/project/create_quota) was a completely silly way to implement a silly idea. But you know, we were young and we needed the money.

As "bad" startup-y stories go, like for most entreupeners working on their first idea, after 8 or 9 month of having zero income we have decided to re-think our idea. We didn't completely decide to shut it down - that happened only years later after a few re-tries. We realized that as we worked on our own project we actually learned a lot on how to build websites. So we un-surprisingily decided to go into the service providers market.

We kept our name "Gizra" which means pattern or sillouhete in Hebrew, and posted in community related sites that there's a new kid in town.
Thanks to our contributions people on the community already knew our names, so the very next day we already got our first 100$ worth of ordered work. We were on the way to the top!

## Technical Recognition

As any new company we have struggeled to get clients (a struggle we still face, although we're already equipped with better tools and understanding to deal with it). Eventhough our income was poor, we have on decided to travel to DrupalCon Paris that was hapenning on 2009.

It was the first time we attended a conference, let alone an international one, and it was a blast. We finally got to meet our Drupal heroes, people we were sometimes in daily contact with them thanks to our contributions and involvment.

We finally had the opportunity to meet in person people like [fago](https://www.drupal.org/u/fago) and [klausi](https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi) and [dasjo](https://www.drupal.org/u/dasjo) that we were working with on the issue queue. Having our first dinner with our new yet old Drupal friends, was in fact a first in what to become many more dinners and DrupalCamps, DrupalCons and other social events. On Paris we got our first taste of the Drupal community, and have been loving it ever since.

Beyond that we were fortunate enough to meet [Moshe Weitzman](https://www.drupal.org/u/moshe-weitzman), a legendary Drupal core contributor who was also having many high profile modules (Drush, Organic groups and others). Moshe knew Amitai from the issue queue, where Amitai was submitting patches to either fix bugs - and most probably introducting new bugs in the process - or suggest new features. As it so happened Moshe was already looking for a new Organic Groups (OG) module maintainer. OG is a high profile module, that exists for ever and is responsible for having mini-site functionality. That is, on a single site, you can spin up as many subsites as you want, and each one can behave completely independently from each other, while still giving the site admin easy way to administer them all.

Moshe has suggested Amitai to take ownership on OG, to which he immediatly replyed no. It was a huge responsibilty and he felt completely un worthy.  
30 minutes later, he said "yes, but you should stick around".  
The next day Amitai has already suggested Moshe a complete re-write of Organic groups.

We retuned back to Israel, with commit access to one of the most important Drupal modules. Even back then we knew this was an important milestone.


## Theatrical Recognition

Even though we were handed a significant module, we were still quite unknown by the international community. We did however hired our first employee: an office manager who was also a project manager, followed by a developer.

Amitai, being the maintainer of Organic groups have indeed started [re-writing](https://www.drupal.org/node/567840) the module and upgrading its architecture in order to make it ready for the, back then, new Drupal 7 release.

A year has passed, Brice had a new baby girl, and Amitai as well, and it was time for DrupalCon Copenhagen (2010). Amitai has submitted a session that was accepted - a session about the new OG for Drupal 7.

Amitai has decided to take a different approach to the talk. Rather than making a boring presentations about the nitty gritty technical asspects, that is which checkbox or button needs to be clicked, give a more theatrical session. Amitai and Brice have performed in the first fifteen minutes of the session a completely [imaginary scenario](http://www.gizra.com/content/og7-session-drupalcon-copenhagen/) where Ban Ki Moon, the secretary general of the UN approached Gizra and commisioned them with building sites for all the countries in the world. Through this story they illustrated the new features of OG.

It's worth mentioning that as much as the scenario was completely ridiculous, in the end of the session one of the people in the audience approached Brice and Amitai and told them he was working in the UN, building an OG site for them - and in fact, our story wasn't so far from the reality.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amitaibu sets a pretty high standard for theatrical presentations.... history in the making! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupalcon?src=hash">#drupalcon</a></p>&mdash; GÃ¡bor Hojtsy (@gaborhojtsy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborhojtsy/status/22181237352">August 26, 2010</a></blockquote>

The impact of this session was immediate, and once again a DrupalCon ended being an important corner stone in Gizra's life. Invitations to appear in different Drupal camps and Drupal events around the globe started coming - events in: Greece, Belgium, France, Spain, Canada and more.
