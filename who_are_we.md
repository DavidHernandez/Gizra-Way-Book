# Who Are We

The question of "who are we" can be hard to answer. Or very simple. It all depends on your point of view. If you are looking at us from far enough than it will be quite simple. We are a web development company.

But looking at things from far can be boring. In fact, if you are reading this chapter you are probably looking at a more zoomed in explanation. So lets zoom.

## Early days

Brice Lenfant and Amitai Burstein, now the co-owners of Gizra have met for the first time at around 1998. Later in 2002 they have re-met through different socials events, by chance became balcony to balcony neighbors. At 2004 they worked together in an Israeli software company for the textille industry.

On 2005 Brice and his wife moved to the New-York, to work as the support and QA manager for the US branch.

On 2006 after Amitai has finished his B.A in fashion design in Shenkar, he and his wife moved to Delhi, India to become the regional manager of the south east area, supervising over a dozen local team.

On 2007 Amitai and Brice combining both their deep knowledge of the textile industry, pattern making and of course software development have invented a new system called MTM (Made To Measure). It was a way for people to enter their body measurements and get a pattern for a garment that fits them precisely. Precision that usually can be reached only by going to a tailor. If for some reason you are interested in seeing how in depth we had the concept covered you can read this [online article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwinkky6CHY9NZHB6HDcrRE88XaG7Avkz456sj1GN4o/edit?usp=sharing) we have published.

Being so excited about this revolutionary approach to MTM we have decided to form a partnership, register our company and work on simplePDM. A web site that would allow pattern makers to digitally manage their files, catalogues and collections. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMj1w3Sx9_U) we created (and we mean _we created_ - we wrote, drew, recorded and edited all ourself back at those days) could help understand the concept. It's like Google Docs, but specific for the textile and garment industry.

The technological decision to go with Drupal we equally owe to a good investment of time in finding the right technology and to pure luck. At the time it seemed better than other options, who no days most of them don't event exist.

As good startup-y stories go, Amitai's balcony was Gizra's office on those early days. Brice and Amitai have started learning Drupal and the world of web. In fact, to be completely honest, while Brice already came with some coding experience it was Amitai's first steps in the coding world.

Embracing from the very beginning the nature of open source we have started contributing back to the community. Gizra's [first module](https://www.drupal.org/project/create_quota) was a completely silly way to implement a silly idea. But you know, we were young and we needed the money.

As "bad" startup-y stories go, like for most entreupeners working on their first idea, after 8 or 9 month of having zero income we have decided to re-think our idea. We didn't completely decide to shut it down - that happened only years later after a few re-tries. We realized that as we worked on our own project we actually learned a lot on how to build websites. So we un-surprisingily decided to go into the service providers market.

We kept our name "Gizra" which means pattern or sillouhete in Hebrew, and posted in community related sites that there's a new kid in town.
Thanks to our contributions people on the community already knew our names, so the very next day we already got our first 100$ worth of ordered work. We were on the way to the top!

## Technical Recognition

As any new company we have struggeled to get clients (a struggle we still face, although we're already equipped with better tools and understanding to deal with it). Eventhough our income was poor, we have on decided to travel to DrupalCon Paris that was hapenning on 2009.

It was the first time we attended a conference, let alone an international one, and it was a blast. We finally got to meet our Drupal heroes, people we were sometimes in daily contact with them thanks to our contributions and involvment.

We finally had the opportunity to meet in person people like [fago](https://www.drupal.org/u/fago) and [klausi](https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi) and [dasjo](https://www.drupal.org/u/dasjo) that we were working with on the issue queue. Having our first dinner with our new yet old Drupal friends, was in fact a first in what to become many more dinners and DrupalCamps, DrupalCons and other social events. On Paris we got our first taste of the Drupal community, and have been loving it ever since.

Beyond that we were fortunate enough to meet [Moshe Weitzman](https://www.drupal.org/u/moshe-weitzman), a legendary Drupal core contributor who was also having many high profile modules (Drush, Organic groups and others). Moshe knew Amitai from the issue queue, where Amitai was submitting patches to either fix bugs - and most probably introducting new bugs in the process - or suggest new features. As it so happened Moshe was already looking for a new Organic Groups (OG) module maintainer. OG is a high profile module, that exists for ever and is responsible for having mini-site functionality. That is, on a single site, you can spin up as many subsites as you want, and each one can behave completely independently from each other, while still giving the site admin easy way to administer them all.

Moshe has suggested Amitai to take ownership on OG, to which he immediatly replyed no. It was a huge responsibilty and he felt completely un worthy.  
30 minutes later, he said "yes, but you should stick around".  
The next day Amitai has already suggested Moshe a complete re-write of Organic groups.

We retuned back to Israel, with commit access to one of the most important Drupal modules. Even back then we knew this was an important milestone.


## Theatrical Recognition

Even though we were handed a significant module, we were still quite unknown by the international community. We did however hired our first employee: an office manager who was also a project manager, followed by a developer.

Amitai, being the maintainer of Organic groups have indeed started [re-writing](https://www.drupal.org/node/567840) the module and upgrading its architecture in order to make it ready for the, back then, new Drupal 7 release.

A year has passed, Brice had a new baby girl, and Amitai as well, and it was time for DrupalCon Copenhagen (2010). Amitai has submitted a session that was accepted - a session about the new OG for Drupal 7.

Amitai has decided to take a different approach to the talk. Rather than making a boring presentations about the nitty gritty technical asspects, that is which checkbox or button needs to be clicked, give a more theatrical session. Amitai and Brice have performed in the first fifteen minutes of the session a completely [imaginary scenario](http://www.gizra.com/content/og7-session-drupalcon-copenhagen/) where Ban Ki Moon, the secretary general of the UN approached Gizra and commissioned them with building sites for all the countries in the world. Through this story they illustrated the new features of OG.

It's worth mentioning that as much as the scenario was completely ridiculous, in the end of the session one of the people in the audience approached Brice and Amitai and told them he was working in the UN, building an OG site for them - and in fact, our story wasn't so far from the reality.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amitaibu sets a pretty high standard for theatrical presentations.... history in the making! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupalcon?src=hash">#drupalcon</a></p>&mdash; GÃ¡bor Hojtsy (@gaborhojtsy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborhojtsy/status/22181237352">August 26, 2010</a></blockquote>

The impact of this session was immediate, and once again a DrupalCon ended being an important corner stone in Gizra's life. Invitations to appear in different Drupal camps and Drupal events around the globe started coming - events in: Greece, Belgium, France, Spain, Canada and more. Each got a completely new presentation.

From a fashion show in DrupalCon London (2011), An Ant eater working on OG in Drupal Dev Days Bruseeles, to a full blow application made for creating [ridiculous issues](http://www.gizra.com/content/gizra-drupalcon-portland/), he always tries to make his presentations informative and interesting.

## First International Client(s)

In 2011 we have received an inquiry in our contact form a request from an Israeli born, New-York residence that worked for a US based startup. They were called Medico.com (after $2 million dollars and 2 years closed) and they were looking for a Drupal web shop. They were building a stackoverflow like platform for QA in the medical industry. That is, when you wake up with an headache, you'd ask what to do, and get answers from the community or paid doctors.

They had a european company working for several month, but they had a feeling they were not the right team for the job. They saw our names as presenters for DrupalCon Chicago, linked us to our OG work, recognized the Israeli name, and the rest was history.

For one year and a half we have worked along with the Nir Yariv, the project manager, who later joined the Gizra team and is now leading some of the most interesting projects we have.

It was our biggest client at the time, paying in dollars and giving us a lot of freedom to constantly iterate and polish our work. We were heavily invested for the first time in automatic testing. The tool we used was bare bone selenium. It was a horrible experience in terms of false positives and taiming the automatic tests, but it showed us what we believed all along. Real platforms can't be built without a certain amount of automatic test coverage.

Even though it was our first international client, we were already work life balance aware. The automatic tests made it possible to maintin it, as the platform hardly broke.

The platform, originally starting in Spanish didn't pick up, so they have decided to translate to English and Portuguese. They required an activity log that could be translated. That was the birth of the [Message ](https://www.drupal.org/project/message) module, later becoming a set of modules know as "the message stack".

The site in Portuguese at a certain point picked up rapidly and we saw heavy use by Portuguese people. This sudden success in the Portuguese market did not impress the investors who pulled the plug and didn't go for round two.

We were five people in the office when we were told the money is going to end in a week or so.

## Commerce Guys

Luck, or asking the universe or whatever you will decide to call it, has brought Commerce Guys (CG) to approach us immediately after the work for Medico has completely terminated.

We have known the owners for some time, and were always both good friends and both sharing similar technical vision. So that might have been the reason for them to ask us to jump on board and help them get their [Commerce Kickstart](http://demo.commerceguys.com/) distribution up and running. Timeline was fierce, given the amount of tasks they wanted to have, and scrutinizing code reviews were in abundance. Just the way we liked it.

If you'll look at our fancy Drupal's installation profile scripts you might not recognize it, but it all started with the work we've done _long_ time ago with CG.

## Harvard University

DrupalCon Denver (2012) has arrived, and not long before it Entity Reference was born (it started with Damien Tournoud from CG who later [asked Amitai](https://youtu.be/hC4RiK-m0BQ?t=7m40s) to become a co-maintainer) and was followed with the complete rewrite of Organic groups for Drupal 7. Didn't you already read about a complete re-write for OG for Drupal 7. Yes you did. However the 7.1 version had flaws that we wanted to fix. So we went ahead and fixed all the architectural issues we have wrongly done in D7. This 7.2 is still up and running, and is the basis for OG for Drupal 8, that has similar concepts just different code (since Drupal 8 is so different from Drupal 7).

Brice and Amitai, for the first time decided to attend a higher Education session. It was by the people of Harvard's OpenScholar (OS) distribution. The presenter, Ferdi Almahdi who was also the project lead of OS started the session by asking Amitai, who he recognized as the OG author:
- "Are you interested in OpenScholar?"  
- "Does it use Organic Groups?", asked Amitai  
- "Yes, a lot" answered Ferdi.  
- "In that case yes, I'm interested".

Little did they know, that it will lead to an ongoing relationship that has already crossed 4 years, and had the peak four full time developers from Gizra side.

It all started from hearing the session, then approach Ferdi and Richard Brandon (once the lead developer, and now the project lead) and offer our services. They said they will contact us when the summer vacation ends, and they did.

They asked if we could give them consulting on how to port the OG vocab module to Drupal 7. Quickly it became obvious that the right way would be for us to take this non-trivial task.

They initially thought we were going to have some per tasks relationship (i.e. we will have a work order per set of tasks), but we immediately recognized it as "foot in the door", and decided to dive into their platform.

We have raised some issues, and gave them suggestions and solutions that were quickly translated to us becoming part of the core team of OpenScholar. This has probably been one of the most important milestones of the early years of Gizra.
