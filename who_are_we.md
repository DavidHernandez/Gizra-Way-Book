# Who Are We
###The Amitai and Brice Story:

A couple of guys, with a pretty interesting perspective, joined forces, synergized, made a lot of mistakes, learned and repeated.  They like the idea of open source, in fact they like the idea of open everything. After plenty of failures and pretty amazing success, these guys, with the help of their team, are still paving the way in the interesting world of web development.

###The Gizra Way:

The Gizra story is about a way, an outlook, a philosophy that navigates all the aspects of a web development company. It is knowing and acting on the understanding that *we can do better.*

It is summed up nicely under four sections of The Gizra Way. Let’s look at them:

**Transparency**.  Everything is out in the open, warts and all.  This may be new to you and may take some adjustment. We set the tone as early as our price estimations by basing them on a detailed breakdown of project tasks (small chunks of 12 hours or less) with an attached cost.  This extends into our projects where our clients have full access to Github. They see everything - including our internal communications. Even this guide is public. 

**Open Communication**. We work hard to create a common language with our clients and to set expectations early on and this applies internally as well.  

**Meticulous Execution**. This area is the core of how we do things.  We implement tested processes to ensure the highest technical standards. For example, a complete deployment and testing system is built into our projects, we use our own Gizra developed testing toolkit, and do pixel-perfect design implementation.

**Investment in you and the community**. We can do better is about bettering ourselves and others as an organization and also as individuals.  You can become better by embracing our mentoring process that will usually keep you on your toes - being a little uncomfortable means you are stretching your bounds.  We also like seeing you want to contribute and encouraged you to do so to the open-source community on company time.

Keep in mind and check yourself against these Gizra values. It will guide you in situations you still don’t have an answer for and set the standards you should want to reach.

###Our Purpose:

A general problem we all face is the high failure rate of web projects due to bad project management. The projects don’t meet any one of the three criteria of success: being on time, in budget,happy users. 

So, if we intersect the Gizra Way with what is going on outside, our purpose becomes clear:

**For Gizra, the world will be a better place if more web projects realize that there is a better way.**

###Our Position

Our purpose probably strikes a chord with anyone who is implementing an IT project of any kind.  We want to reach the places that can appreciate that there is a better way.  Hence, we believe our message best reaches seasoned executive who have seen enough web projects to get burned. They may have already resigned to the idea that that is how projects are run but know deep down that there has to be another way. Our target clients are most probably in medium sized organizations but really its about anywhere a brave executive can successfully influence their organization to adopt a new, simple, and sometimes radical, way of doing things.

**For** medium sized companies

**Who** have settled for mediocrity

Gizra is a web solution provider

**That** understands your needs and grows the project with you

**Unlike** most web development companies

Gizra’s budget driven approach with deep technical expertise results in better executed projects.

###Our Personality

Our unusual [About Story](http://www.gizra.com/content/the-about-story/) should get the point across pretty well.
