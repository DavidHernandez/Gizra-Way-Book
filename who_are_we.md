# Who Are We

The question of "who are we" can be hard to answer. Or very simple. It all depends on your point of view. If you are looking at us from far enough than it will be quite simple. We are a web development company.

But looking at things from far can be boring. In fact, if you are reading this chapter you are probably looking at a more zoomed in explanation. So lets zoom.

## Early days

Brice Lenfant and Amitai Burstein, now the co-owners of Gizra have met for the first time at around 1998. Later in 2002 they have re-met through different socials events, by chance became balcony to balcony neighbors. At 2004 they worked together in an Israeli software company for the textille industry.

On 2005 Brice and his wife moved to the New-York, to work as the support and QA manager for the US branch.

On 2006 after Amitai has finished his B.A in fashion design in Shenkar, he and his wife moved to Delhi, India to become the regional manager of the south east area, supervising over a dozen local team.

On 2007 Amita and Brice combining both their deep knowledge of the textile industry, pattern making and of course software development have invented a new system called MTM (Made To Measure). It was a way for people to enter their body measurements and get a pattern for a garment that fits them precisely. Precision that usually can be reached only by going to a tailor. If for some reason you are interested in seeing how in depth we had the concept covered you can read this [online article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwinkky6CHY9NZHB6HDcrRE88XaG7Avkz456sj1GN4o/edit?usp=sharing) we have published.

Being so excited about this revolutionary approach to MTM we have decided to form a partnership, register our company and work on simplePDM. A web site that would allow pattern makers to digitally manage their files, catalogues and collections. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMj1w3Sx9_U) we created (and we mean _we created_ - we wrote, drew, recorded and edited all ourself back at those days) could help understand the concept. It's like Google Docs, but specific for the textile and garment industry.

The technological decision to go with Drupal we equally owe to a good investment of time in finding the right technology and to pure luck. At the time it seemed better than other options, who no days most of them don't event exist.

As good startup-y stories go, Amitai's balcony was Gizra's office on those early days. Brice and Amitai have started learning Drupal and the world of web. In fact, to be completely honest, while Brice already came with some coding experience it was Amitai's first steps in the coding world.

Embracing from the very beginning the nature of open source we have started contributing back to the community. Gizra's [first module](https://www.drupal.org/project/create_quota) was a completely silly way to implement a silly idea. But you know, we were young and we needed the money.

As "bad" startup-y stories go, like for most entreupeners working on their first idea, after 8 or 9 month of having zero income we have decided to re-think our idea. We didn't completely decide to shut it down - that happened only years later after a few re-tries. We realized that as we worked on our own project we actually learned a lot on how to build websites. So we un-surprisingily decided to go into the service providers market.

We kept our name "Gizra" which means pattern or sillouhete in Hebrew, and posted in community related sites that there's a new kid in town.
Thanks to our contributions people on the community already knew our names, so the very next day we already got our first 100$ worth of ordered work. We were on the way to the top!
