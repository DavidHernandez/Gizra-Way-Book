* Productivity - take responsibility for your time and tasks. Be productive so you can balance between work and personal life.

* Investing time in learning beyond working hours - **learning, not projects!** We have no intention that Gizra employees will work beyond of working hours, but we have the expectation Gizra employees continuing to develop their professionally all the time. 
Gizra supports it as well as part of the work:
 - Full-time roll responsible for training.
