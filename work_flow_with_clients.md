# Work Flow with Clients

Sales did their job. They worked hard to bring in a potential client and now we are at the critical point of finding out their needs and providing a price offer. 

| | Step | Owner(s) | Documents |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Discovery - meeting(s) to understand our potential client's needs | Sales + Account Manager |  |
| 2 | Proposal - budget goggles | Account Manager + Operations Manager | Price Offer spreadsheet +  Price Proposal document |
| 3 | Terms of work - triggered by client accepting the proposal | Account Manager + Operations Manager | Scope Of Work + Master Service Agreement |
| 4 | Project Milestones - reach agreed upon payment milestones | Account Manager | email to Operations Manager |
| 5 | Accounts Receivable | Operations Manager | Invoicing |

###Documentation:
It is really important to use one 'master' source for all of our documentation. This allows us to continue updating one document and ensures we are consistent with all our clients.
