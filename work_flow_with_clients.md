# Work Flow with Clients

Sales did their job. They worked hard to bring in a potential client and now we are at the critical point of finding out their needs and providing a price offer. This is also where the clients interact with more of us at Gizra which is great but also a potential pitfall for misunderstandings. We want to avoid this and hence, the purpose of this section is to clearly outline who is involved and what documents we use at the various stages of our interaction with clients. 

Here is the outline:

| | Stage | Owner(s) | Documents |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Discovery meeting(s)  | Sales + Account Manager |  |
| 2 | Price Proposal | Account Manager + Operations Manager | Price Offer spreadsheet +  Work Proposal document |
| 3 | Terms of work | Account Manager + Operations Manager | Scope Of Work + Master Service Agreement |
| 4 | Payment Milestones  | Account Manager | email? to Operations Manager |
| 5 | Accounts Receivable | Operations Manager | Invoicing |

###Stage 1: Discovery Meeting(s)
At this point, Sales invites the Account Manager to join the meetings. The Account Manager will be the primary contact for the clients in navigating through their project and therefore it makes sense that they join at this early stage. It is also reassuring to the clients to know their main contact before jumping into a project.

###Stage 2: Price Proposal
The Account Manager is responsible for preparing both the Price Offer spreadsheet and the Work Proposal document.  

??? Operation Manager - responsibility?

###Stage 3: Terms of Work
This is triggered by client accepting the proposal.  We use two documents as our contract with our clients: Scope of Work (SOW) document and a Master Service Agreement (MSA).

??? Operations Manager - responsibility? work with lawyer, etc.

###Stage 4: Payment Milestones
As the project progresses, the Account Manager is responsible for updating the Operations Manager when agreed upon payment milestones have been met with an **e-mail???** that includes the following information.

??? What information required for Op Mgt to invoice?

###Stage 5: Account Receivable
???


###Master Documentation Source:
It is really important to use one 'master' source for all of our documentation. This allows us to continue updating one document and ensures we are consistent with all our clients.

* Price Offer Spreadsheet
* Work Proposal Document
  * Project and Retainer
  * Retainer only
* Scope of Work
* Master Service Agreement
* Milestone email?
