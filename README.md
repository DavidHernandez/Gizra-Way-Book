The Gizra Way Definitive Guide

The Gizra Way to write the Gizra Way Gitbook. 
Some guidelines:
1. Document the **bottom line**. Processes that have been tested already and work. Cut out fluff.
2. **Iterate**. If this document is not a live document, its useless.
3. For every standard, provide a way, preferably automatic, to **monitor** it.
