**The Gizra Way Definitive Guide**

This book is the definitive guide to the Gizra Way, and it tries to encapsulate both the technical
aspects along with the culture.

The idea is that there is always a place for everyone to go and better understand the expectations from them and the processes that we have. For doing that we document only processes that have been tested and work. We are trying our best to cut out fluff and give the bottom line.

Even though this guide is public to the entire world, we are not afraid of exposing also unpleasant mistakes we had, or touch sensitive subjects. Actually, we even enjoy it. In a way that's also part of the Gizra Way - having this slight uncomfortable feeling. We found that we learn and improve way better and way faster once we are outside of our comfort zone, and share with others our experiences.
