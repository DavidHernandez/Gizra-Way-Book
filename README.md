**The Gizra Way Definitive Guide**

*The Gizra Way* to write *The Gizra Way GitBook*. Some guidelines:

1. Document the **bottom line**. Include only processes that have been tested and work. Cut out fluff.
2. **Iterate**. If this document is not a live document, its useless.
3. For every standard provide a way, preferably automatic, to **monitor** it.
