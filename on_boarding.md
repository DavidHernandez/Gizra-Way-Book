# On Boarding

Hi there newbie, welcome to Gizra. Hate the word newbie? Meh, don't feel bad about it.
Not only we were newbies our self, but part of "The Gizra Way" is always exploring new places where we are still newbies. In other words, we probably know how you feel.

In this coming week you will get a bunch of different tasks you will need to accomplish. Here are some of the guide lines behind those tasks:

* We want to get your comfortable with "The Gizra Way". Even if you still don't fully get what it is, you are in fact already experiencing it.
* We want to get you a bit uncomfortable. You are challenged with tasks you are not sure how to solve in the given timebox. It will force you to reach out and learn when, who and how to ask questions.
* We want to give you a feeling of the many different elements that compile into a project. We will not go deep due to time constraints, and since we think that first steps should give you a broader
view of the operation rather than diving in deep.

## Confusion & Leap of Faith

Experience shows that you already are or very soon will feel confused. A lot of the material can be new,
and even if you are a seasoned developer and have years of Drupal experience you might now know some of the stuff. It's ok, we know that. In fact, we sometimes do things differently from what is perceived as "the right way", simply because we have a different set of believes on what "right" is.

## What's Next

When the on boarding week finishes you will still have much more to learn. However, you got a taste of how projects are being done in Gizra.
You learned that we are not afraid at throwing you into the deep water, but on the same time we keep any eye to see you are not drowning. In fact, you might have occasionally drowned in the on boarding process. There's a value for that to, as we hope it encouraged you to reach out for help (if you didn't or we missed, please let us know - as we want to improve our process).

Training isn't done. It's just changing a phase, so instead of having imaginary tasks, you will not be added to one of the existing teams, on an existing project.
