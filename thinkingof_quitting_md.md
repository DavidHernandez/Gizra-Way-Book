# Thinking of quitting

You have reached the point you are thinking of quitting your job at Gizra. That's fair, we've all been in this situation. In fact, we think we might be able to guide you through this.

First, you'll need to figure out why you have this feeling. It can be the outcome of different good or bad conditions, so lets divide them:

## Positive reasons

**You got a better offer from another company**

Financial improvements are important. If your offer is way above your current salary, then it's definitely worth considering it. If you feel that the existing advantages we provide - the technological challenges, the working environment, the sane working hours - will be provided in the next place, then it sounds like the right thing.

If you'll tell us you want to leave because you got a better offer, know we never provide a counter offer. This is done out of fairness, to avoid the "why not offer you better conditions before? Why did we have to wait for the last minute". This is another reason for our management to keep a close eye, and make sure people are compensated as they should.

**You want a career change**

A career change can actually be an outcome of both positive and negative reasons. You may have had enough of your current profession, or you may just be intrigued by a new field.

Either way, it's worth reaching out and discussing this with us. We might be able to adapt your position to include your new passion.

## Negative reasons

**You don't get along with your direct boss**

As in any social situation, people might not get along. And like any social situation, it's worth raising the point early on.

Admittedly it would be hard to completely avoid each other, nor is this encouraged. We are working hard on establishing a professional working environment, where being friendly isn't just a bonus.

With that said we can consider shifting people from one team to another.

If the case is not getting along with the owners, then you might be intimidated to discuss it with them alone. First, don't be afraid - they are people too, and it's in their interest as-well to solve the situation. Further more, you are also encouraged you to approach HR or another liaison and have them help you with this matter.

**Your role is no longer pleasant**

Is it because you have been doing for too long and just had enough? Sounds fair.
Do you have other skills you would like to develop? We might be able to help you shape your new role. Even if we don't have this role currently, don't hesitate to offer it - accompanied with good selling points. 

Obviously, if your desire is being a soccer coach we won't be able to help. But if it's related to our industry, we will work hard with you on finding the balance between the company needs, and your desires.

**You don't feel appreciated**

Say something about it, being shy won't help here. If you are doing something you should be acknowledged about it. We try to stay fair, but both pointing out good work in the same manner we point out bad work. Constant review and feedback is in the core of our culture.

Furthermore, determine if your work is being bubbled up properly. If it is not ,e.g. as an account manager no one seems to appreciate all your projects are right on time, find a way to make it clear. It doesn't have to be a meeting, which we normally discourage, but rather some mechanism to show success/ failure. For example, if we had an automatic notification alerting in deviation from the estimation could help make your work more visible (luckily we have such alert in place)
