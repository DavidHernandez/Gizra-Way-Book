# Thinking of quitting

You have reached the point you are thinking of quitting Gizra. That's fair, we've all been in this situation. In fact, we think we might be able to guide you through this.

First, you'll need to figure out why you have this feeling. It can be the outcome of different good or bad conditions, so lets divide them:

## Positive reasons

**You got a better offer from another company**

Financial improvements are important. If your offer is way above your current salary, then it's definitely worth considering it. If you feel that the existing advantages we provide - the technological challenges, the working environment, the sane working hours - will be provided in the next place, then it sounds like the right thing.

If you'll tell us you want to leave because you got a better offer, know we never provide a counter offer. This is done out of fairness, to avoid the "why not offer you better conditions before? Why did we have to wait for the last minute". This is another reason for our management to keep a close eye, and make sure people get compensated as they should.

**You want to have a career change**

A career change can actually be an outcome of both positive and negative reasons. You might had enough of your current profession, or you might just intrigued by a new field.

Either way, it's worth reaching out and discussing this with us. We might be able to adapt your position to include your new passion.

## Negative reasons

**You don't get along with your direct boss**

As in any social situation, people might not get along. And like any social situation, it's worth raising the point early on.

Admittedly it would be hard to completely avoid each other, nor is this encouraged. We are working hard on establishing a professional working environment, where being friendly isn't just a bonus.

We that said we can consider shifting people from one team to another.

If the case is not getting along with the owners, then you might be intimidated to discuss it with them alone. First, don't be afraid - they are people to, and it's in their interest to solve the situation. Further more, you are also encouraged you to approach HR and have them help you with this matter.

**Your role is no longer pleasant**

**You don't feel appreciated**
