# Thinking of quitting

You have reached the point you are thinking of quitting Gizra. That's fair, we've all been in this situation. In fact, we think we might be able to guide you through this.

First, you'll need to figure out why you have this feeling. It can be the outcome of different good or bad conditions, so lets divide them:

## Positive reasons

**You got a better offer from another company**

Financial improvements are important. If your offer is way above your current salary, then it's definitely worth considering it. If you feel that the existing advantages we provide - the technological challenges, the working environment, the sane working hours - will be provided in the next place, then it sounds like the right thing.

If you'll tell us you want to leave because you got a better offer, know we never provide a counter offer. This is done out of fairness, to avoid the "why not offer you better conditions before? Why did we have to wait for the last minute". This is another reason for our management to keep a close eye, and make sure people get compensated as they should.

**You want to have a career change**

## Negative reasons

You don't get along with your direct boss

You are not doing what you like

You don't feel appreciated
