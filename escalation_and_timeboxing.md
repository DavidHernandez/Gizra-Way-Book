# Escalation and Timeboxing


The Goal of this chapter is to clarify Gizra’s core project management processes.


## Activity Process


### 1. Create weekly plan

On Thursday Account Manager create weekly plan and Team Lead assigns the tasks to the developers. Every Developer gets his/her tasks for the next week.  
Note: priority is indicated by how high up the task is on the list.  
Exception: QA has it’s own board and it works on an ongoing list - not a weekly plan.


### 2. Go over the tasks

On Sunday Developer goes over all his/her tasks and do the following:
1. **Make sure you understand the task**. Ask question until you do.
2. **Check time boxing**. If it doesn’t make sense to you, communicate that to your team lead. 
3. **Write user stories** (where applicable) **and outline solution** (title in Github ## Solution Outline). If you are not sure about the solution, tag your team lead to review it.

Team lead gives goes over the outline solutions and give input if necessary.

### 3. Write code

The rest of the week:
Developers write code and fix bugs as needed.  
Read [How to submit a PR].  
Team leads review and give direction to solve problems.


| Activity Type | Activity is clear | Prep | Plan | Implement |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Task | Understand the issue?* | Check timeboxing.* | Write user stories and outline solution.* | Write code and Review (again and again and again!!!). |
| Bug | Expected vs actual? | Reproduce bug. | List affecting areas with strategies & priority. | Implement strategies. |

*Weekly Prep (1st day of week)


## Escalation Process



## Time Boxing

1. Timeboxing is the **amount of time set to complete a task**.
2. It is a tool to provide a price proposal to the clients and manage our project resources.
3. Timeboxing is based on an **average** skilled developer (NOT according to who will be doing the task).
4. Each developer has a **personal factor** ( x * timebox) of how much time they take to complete a task per the timebox.
  * Each developer knows their own number.
  * It’s an overall average usually based on at least 6 months of development. 
  * It’s dependent on ramp-up requirements per project (you may be a skilled developer but you now have a project of with a technology that is new to you).

5. **Escalation in timebox** - Every developer works a little different.  Decide at what points of the timebox, you stop and check where you are (use personal factor to help here). Work with Team Lead to create a structure that works for you.
6. **Timeboxing factor** (actual time vs. set timebox) is a nonspecific indicator. It is used to raise red flags in areas that need attention - many of the them are not related to the developers capabilities. Issues can be:
  * Is the timebox assessment to the client wrong?
  * The task may not make sense.
  * Is the task clear - explained well and understood well?
  * Where is a developer struggling and if we can support with training?
  * Where as a company can we do better?


## Report in Productivity

1. Be accurate in reporting! We need real numbers to help us as a company do our best. It's not about nit picking with employees.
2. Update every day. This is important for our reporting with the clients.
3. Expectations: 9 hour days, we expect to see 6-8 hours of productive time. Yes, take breaks as needed but when you work, work well!
4. Non-project reporting:
  * **IT issues** - Install issues are taken into consideration.
  * **Training** - Sessions and practice.
  * **Gizra Meetings** - Company wide meetings and personal meetings with operations manager.
  * **Business Development** -  It includes any work on gizra.com, Blog post, marketing and RFP materials.
5. Installments and set-ups - report inside the project with label “Installation and set-up”.
