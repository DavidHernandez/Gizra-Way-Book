# Escalation and Timeboxing


The Goal of this chapter is to clarify Gizra’s core project management processes.


## Activity Process


### 1. Create weekly plan

On Thursday Account Manager create weekly plan and Team Lead assigns the tasks to the developers. Every Developer gets his/her tasks for the next week.  
Note: priority is indicated by how high up the task is on the list.  
Exception: QA has it’s own board and it works on an ongoing list - not a weekly plan.


### 2. Go over the tasks

On Sunday Developer goes over all his/her tasks and do the following:
1. **Make sure you understand the task**. Ask question until you do.
2. **Check time boxing**. If it doesn’t make sense to you, communicate that to your team lead. 
3. **Write user stories** (where applicable) **and outline solution** (title in Github ## Solution Outline). If you are not sure about the solution, tag your team lead to review it.

Team lead gives goes over the outline solutions and give input if necessary.

### 3. Write code

The rest of the week:
Developers write code and fix bugs as needed.  
Read [How to submit a PR].  
Team leads review and give direction to solve problems.
