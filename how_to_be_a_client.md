# How to be a Client

How to be a good client is really "how to position yourself to get the most out of your relationship with Gizra (or any development agency, really)." Many, if not most, vendor-client relationships break down down over communication. Since communication is, by definition, a two-sided process, it's essential to understand how to best participate in the dialogue. The Gizra way provides a good foundation for open and transparent communication. What follows is an exploration of that foundation from a client perspective.

##Think about your project as a list of features

##Think about which features are "must haves" and which you can do without

## Have good background knowledge about the ways your project may achieved
You don't need to be a subject-matter expert in all of the technology available for your project, but it's a good idea to have some working knowledge of what's out there. It puts you in a better position to ask clarifying questions (see below) and allows you to be a part of technical decisions in your project (some of which are made before you even begin).

## Ask a lot of questions
Any time you find yourself not understanding, ask a clarifying question. This is the "two-way street" part of communication. It's your job to be informed about your project, and i't Gizra's job too keep you informed. If at any point, this two-way street feels only one way, that's the time to start asking questions. If you find this happens repeatedly, that might be a good time to set a meeting (or dedicate scrum time) with you project lead to devise a better strategy to keep you fully informed.
