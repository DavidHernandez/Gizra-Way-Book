3. The guy (or girl) who takes the jobs start working on it and ask for clarification if needed.
4. When the Markup guy is finish and post the Html/Css files, you deliver it to our QA staff (Savyon or David B.), and they continue the communication with the Markup guy until the job is done to our satisfaction (then the guy get paid).
