Markup is the process which we take design sketch and convert them to Html/Css files. 
The purpose of this chapter is to understand to process of creating markup with outsourcing providers.
 
###Prepare the instruction file
Create an explanation file contains the design sketch and instructions to the Markup guy (or girl).  
you can see example here [url].
Highlight
* Be sure to consider all elements of the sketch.
* If there is a separate design for mobile Web, be sure to refer to it.
* Pointed out the various devices which need to be checked.



2. Post the job offer here (ask Brice for more details, he is the one responsible for posting jobs).  
3. The guy (or girl) who takes the jobs start working on it and ask for clarification if needed.
4. When the Markup guy is finish and post the Html/Css files, you deliver it to our QA staff (Savyon or David B.), and they continue the communication with the Markup guy until the job is done to our satisfaction (then the guy get paid).
