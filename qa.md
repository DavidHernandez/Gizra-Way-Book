# Quality Assurance in Gizra

What is QA and why do we need it?

Most of us don't really understand a lot of car mechanics and yet when we see 
our car washed and clean after a visit in the garage we feel like our car 
mechanic gets reliable and excellent job. 
He did more than what is required of him and washed our car.
Of course it means nothing, he could be the worst car mechanic in the world but 
the fact that he showed an initiative makes him automatically batter than the
others.
Because my goal is to be the best, that's enough reason for me to start building
a comprehensive and professional QA department worth his ability of importance 
as the development department.
