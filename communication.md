# Communicating in Gizra

Let’s talk about communicating internally in Gizra.  

Today, Gizra’s main office is in Tel Aviv Israel (GMT +2) with 16 Israeli employees that use the office in
varied ways, ranging anywhere from showing up 5 days/week during traditional work hours (~6 people) all the
way
to working remotely and coming into the office once/week (~2 people). There is a lot of flexibility both in
work times and where employees sit and this is mostly determined by role and the person’s circumstances.  

Gizra’s recent hiring strategy has introduced a wonderful group of distributed employees that form almost half
the company, span across 7 countries (North America and Europe), and several timezones.

This has been wonderful for Gizra but it also comes with the need to rethink how we communicate with each
other. This is very important and we ALL need to be mindful of it.  

##Tools we have available

###Slack
This is where the group discussion happen. Each group should have an owner to moderate and ensure that
questions are answered and help given.
“general” channel - a place to say hi, watercooler talk, ask questions that make sense to ask the whole
company.
Role specific groups like “devstuff” or “account_managers”.
Project specific groups. It depends on the project but most projects have two groups. The first for team
discussions, questions, or an ask for help that does not make sense to have in Github.  The second group
usually named “projectname_github” is Github integrated for anyone who wants Slack notifications for Github
activity.
Other: fun stuff like “nuntius_talks” bot or anything else that someone would like to open.

###Github
This is where the project issues are communicated.
The chapters about Pull Requests cover how to communicate in Github. However, it is worth mentioning that the
goal is to write liberally and make things easy to understand so anyone, at anytime, located anywhere can
read it, and know how to proceed.

###Hangouts
This is where the one on one chats and conversations happen. Make sure you have a working camera, speaker, and earphones.
Using the chat is the equivalent of poking your head into someone’s office to ask a quick question like  “what was that word for…?” It’s that quick answer you need to keep your work moving along.

Not everything can be done in asynchronous communication. There are times that conversation problem solving
is needed.  Initiating conversation on Hangouts with a “ping” can be more effective than if you were sitting
in the same office and poked your head in to ask if the person can talk. A “ping” allows the person to get
back to you only when they can.  You are not disturbing the person. If you work per Gizra’s escalation
process you should not be reluctant to ping the person you are suppose to escalate to.  And have the meeting
with the video on. Visual queues are important in conversation.

###Notifications
There are various notification options for all of these tools so please use them. If you get distracted
easily by notifications then turn off the non-critical channels.  However, don’t totally disconnect. Just
make that effort to peek-in once a day. You know the way you work best.

###Google Calendar
It is not always easy to figure out who is in or out of the office. We encourage using the calendar to help
with this.  Please make your Gizra calendar available for other employees to see and indicate when you are
“Out of the office” during your usual work hours. Your usual work hours are indicated in the company contact
list. You will see plenty of people indicating “Coming in late” or “Leaving early” or ”Day off” or “Remote”
(for employees who usually sit in the office).

###Doing it better.
If the mixture of communication is not the most effective for you to get the job done, communicating this -
it may be as easy as asking the Account Manager to set 10 minutes aside every day to have a quick chat and
use that time only if needed.  

###In person meet-up.
We understand that it is easier to maintain relationships remotely rather than build them. On occasion, we
plan to congregate the company to give that face to face time that makes working together so much easier.
