# Our Brand

###The Gizra Way:

The Gizra story is about a way, an outlook, a philosophy that navigates all the internal and external aspects of a web development company. It is knowing and acting on the understanding that *we can do better.*

It is summed up nicely under four sections of The Gizra Way. Let’s look at them:

**Transparency**.  Everything is out in the open, warts and all.  This may be new to you and may take some adjustment. We set the tone as early as our price estimations by basing them on a detailed breakdown of project tasks (small chunks of 12 hours or less) with an attached cost.  This extends into our projects where our clients have full access to Github. They see everything - including our internal communications. Even this book is public. 

**Open Communication**. We work hard to create a common language with our clients and to set expectations early on and this applies internally as well.  

**High Standards**. This is our core. We work at keeping high standards and it pays off because we have become experts clients turn to. For example, a complete deployment system is built into our projects, we use our own Gizra developed testing toolkit, and do pixel-perfect design implementation.

**Investment in you and the community**. We can do better is about bettering ourselves and others as an organization and also as individuals.  You can become better by embracing our mentoring process that will usually keep you on your toes - being a little uncomfortable means you are stretching your bounds.  We also like seeing you want to contribute and encouraged you to do so to the open-source community on company time.

Keep in mind and check yourself against these Gizra values. They will guide you in situations where you still don’t have an answer and set the standards you should want to reach.

###Our Purpose:

A general problem our industry faces is the high failure rate of web projects due to bad project management. The projects usually do not meet any one of the three criteria of success: being on time, in budget,happy users. 

So, if we intersect the Gizra Way with what is going on outside, our purpose becomes clear:

**For Gizra, the world will be a better place if more web projects realize that there is a better way.**

###Our Position

Our position is revisited every year to make sure we are focusing on the right potential client groups - find the clients that [fit](http://www.gizra.com/fit/). Our purpose probably strikes a chord with anyone who has implemented an IT project of any kind.  We want to reach the clients that can appreciate that there needs to be a better way.  Hence, for now at least, we believe our message best reaches seasoned executive who have seen enough web projects to get burned. They may have already resigned to the idea that that is how projects are run but know deep down that there has to be another way. Our target clients are medium to large organizations but really it's about any place a brave decision maker can successfully influence their organization to adopt a new, simple, and sometimes radical, way of doing things.

**For** medium to large organizations

**Who** have settled for mediocrity

Gizra is a web solution provider

**That** understands their client's needs and grows the project with them

**Unlike** most web development companies

Gizra’s budget driven approach with deep technical expertise results in better executed projects.

###Our Personality

Our unusual [About Story](http://www.gizra.com/content/the-about-story/) should get the point across pretty well.

###Our Core Strengths

We love doing projects that challenge us. This naturally led us to excel at the two edges of web development projects:

**Complex Content Management Systems** Gizra was born from here. We joined the Drupal community pretty early on and had the privilege to pioneered many of the core Drupal modules that serve complex client challenges.  Yes, we are experts here, and it's because we love solving problems.

**Lean Demonstration of a Product Idea** This can be a prototype, a Minimal Viable Product, or Proof of Concept. The challenge here is how to make the most of a limited budget and short iteration. Our budget driven approach gives us a great advantage here since we know how to define the project well and time-box it both on a project wide level (3-4 months, 1-3 developers) and at the individual task level.

Don't get it wrong, we do and enjoy projects that also sit in the middle of these two edges. Every project lets us practice and teaches us a little more about how we can be better.

###Our Tools
Drupal is not the only open source tool in our toolbox. We are also creative users of and active participants in the communities for projects such as Symfony, AngularJS, Jekyll, and Elm. We tend to sit at the bleeding-edge of web technologies because that is where all the fun is. We are always looking out for better ways to do things.
